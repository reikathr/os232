* [How to Use Vim â€“ Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vim-beginners-guide/) ---
A helpful guide to using Vim. I chose the link because it helped me create and edit files through Vim for this assignment.
* [Linux For Dummies Cheatsheet](https://www.dummies.com/article/technology/computers/operating-systems/linux/linux-for-dummies-cheat-sheet-209505/) --
An article with Linux commands. It seems interesting to me because it explains the uses of plenty of commands in a concise way.
